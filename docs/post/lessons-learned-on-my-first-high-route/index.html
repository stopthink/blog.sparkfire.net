<h2 id="a-little-about-me">A little about me</h2>

<p>After joining one of Andrew&rsquo;s last Backpacking Fundamentals trips in 2015, I decided to put my skills to the test by tackling section 4 of the Wind River High Route. Prior to that I had completed several trips on the Appalachian Trail and on the Florida Trail. The Wind River High Route not only promised adventure but freedom from fixed itineraries, designated campsites and complex permitting schemes.</p>

<h2 id="now-this-is-the-stuff-off-trail-is-where-it-s-at">Now THIS is the stuff, off-trail is where it&rsquo;s at</h2>

<p>For this easterner, even the on-trail portions of my WRHR section hike were amazing. It was hard not to be smitten with the Wyoming backcountry leading east from Elkhart Park Trailhead. I moved quickly, only stopping for a quick lunch at Photographers Point to dust off my map-and-compass skills by identifying peaks towering over Titcomb Basin, my intended exit path later in the week.</p>

<p>Many miles later on the outskirts of Bald Mountain Basin, my trip really started. I felt close to something I&rsquo;d been looking for during all my time outdoors. That sense of freedom, adventure, and natural autonomy. I was heading into the wilderness alone; no boundaries, no fences, and (mostly) no trails. Leaving Fremont Trail I crossed a threshold for unmarked land with no fixed course. I was thrilled.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-guide">Trust the guide</h2>

<p>Initially I was worried that Andrew&rsquo;s detailed guide to the WRHR would take away some of the magic. I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the sense of adventure. But those worries were unfounded. One of my goals for this trip was to practice my route-finding and map-and-compass skills.  Andrew&rsquo;s maps included helpful notes but left plenty of opportunity to make my own judgements and my own mistakes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Moving up through Bald Mountain Basin I bumped a pair of mule deer and watched them bounce off into one of the many invisible folds of terrain that I would later come to grapple with. With a full view of Angel Pass, I had plenty of time to consider the path ahead. Without a guide, it would never occur to me to try traveling over Angel Pass. Distance flattens terrain and makes steep paths look like vertical rock. But Angel Pass hardly even warrants a mention in Andrew&rsquo;s guide so I took it on faith that it would go.</p>

<h2 id="map-and-compass-is-not-route-finding">Map and compass is not route-finding</h2>

<p>And go it did. This was my first significant route-finding challenge. In my mind, I had two main options. First, I could take a literal reading of the guide and walk down into the bottom of the basin and march straight up the pass. Or I could stay high and avoid elevation loss by following a slightly longer route north around the basin and hope to connect to a long, grassy bench beneath Angel Peak. I learned fast that you can only see so much from one position, and without walking all over, you have to make a decision with limited information. Knowing how to use a map and compass, knowing how to interpret contour lines, or how to shoot a bearing doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to effective route-finding without experience in the field.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Looping north looked promising, but what does the map says?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you&rsquo;re evaluating an off-trail trip you have to account for route-finding issues. Andrew provides a &ldquo;Skurka Time&rdquo; spreadsheet with his guide, but don&rsquo;t let that fool you into thinking that time on the high route is just about fitness. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can grind out the optimal path as fast as Andrew does if you can&rsquo;t find the optimal path to begin with. This was a lesson I learned over and over. Don&rsquo;t be too optimistic with your schedule if this is your first time off-trail.</p>

<h2 id="this-country-is-big-real-big">This country is big, real big</h2>

<p>Cresting the top of Angel Pass was one of the best experiences of my life. The sense of accomplishment was unforgettable, and the views were worth every step. Looking east beyond the continental divide and west across the front country I&rsquo;d just crossed, I was engulfed in endless miles of mountain country. The excitement and wonder of my ascent slid into feelings of isolation and vulnerability.  It was intimidating, and the east side of Angel Pass looked like one heinous boulder field. It took me hours to get down. Having to be that &ldquo;on&rdquo; for so many hours, knowing that with any step you could fall, sprain an ankle, turn a rock and be pinned there for hours or days, is something to be reckoned with. Descending took every bit of my focus, and it wasn&rsquo;t until I bottomed out that I could begin to process and think about what lay ahead.</p>




    <img src="/post/lessons-learned-on-my-first-high-route/wrhr9.jpg" />



<p>The next few hours of the Wind&rsquo;s &ldquo;high quality backcountry walking&rdquo; was refreshing and helped me recharge. Just another cycle in the ebb and flow of my mood on longer backcountry trips. It was at this point when I realized that I did not bring enough sunscreen. A stupid mistake, a tiny little blemish in an otherwise extremely well-executed gear plan. But that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing sowing doubt in my mind. Angel Pass wasn&rsquo;t physically difficult or logistically challenging, but it did wear on me. And it readjusted my perception of the many taller and more difficult passes to come. After hours of rock-hopping, I was not ready to consider Alpine Lakes in my near future. By the time I made it down to camp at Golden Lakes, I&rsquo;d made up my mind that I was going to bail out.</p>

<h2 id="be-prepared-to-fail">Be prepared to fail</h2>

<p>It was tough to make a decision that felt like failure. But by that point, the nagging doubts in my mind were piling up: the extreme remoteness, the lack of sunscreen under a relentless sun, the nagging pain from a rolled ankle. When I picked this trip, I didn&rsquo;t have a realistic idea of what tackling this high route would be like. But I did prepare for that eventuality, and changing my plans mid-trip was easy. It was extremely satisfying to pull out my overview map and chart a course south down through a valley to which I had never been, never planned to go, and that was not my guide book. I marveled that at one point I had considered leaving the overview map at home.</p>

<p>How I &ldquo;failed&rdquo; on the WRHR and still had the trip of my life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="going-alone-is-hard">Going alone is hard</h2>

<p>Other than a couple camped at Golden Lakes, I had the backcountry all to myself. Although I would have preferred to hike with a partner, there&rsquo;s a lot to like about hiking alone. Decision making is easy and efficient, for better or worse. You can go where and when you want, without concern for anyone else&rsquo;s goals, physical ability, or safety. Still, I think going alone was the key factor in not finishing the route as planned. Going alone meant being more conservative with my decision making, and it was easier for me to quit without someone there to psych me up for another pass. Bring partners who share your abilities and goals if completing a trip as planned is important for you. But if you are forced to go alone, it can be done, but don&rsquo;t underestimate the mental challenges you&rsquo;ll face in addition to the physical ones.</p>

<p>I hope my story encourages some first-timers to get out there this summer and try something that really challenges them. If I can be of any help, feel free to drop me a line. <a href="mailto:david@sparkfire.net">david@sparkfire.net</a>.</p>

<p>And a big thanks again to Andrew for putting together such a thoughtfully designed guide, and for generously taking the time to answer all of my questions prior to my trip.</p>
