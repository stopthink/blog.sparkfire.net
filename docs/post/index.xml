      <description>This was my first time fly fishing ever. After attending St Peter&amp;rsquo;s Fly Fishing school on Saturday, I went out on the water on my own in search of trout.
I got on the water around 8am, and it was a beautiful day, sunny and fairly warm. Just the day before it was cold and rainy, the precipitation coming down as rain and snow intermittently.
The Cache la Poudre River is one of the last remaining freestone rivers on the front range, meaning that it flows seasonally with the snowmelt.</description>

      <description>Here in Colorado we have the pleasure of chasing after a mountain dwelling sub-species of turkey, the Merriam&amp;rsquo;s. They live in the mountains, migrate up and down with the snow line, are vocal breeders and can be called, just like elk! We dove in this year trying something new and had a blast.
Pre-Season Scouting The idea for this hunt first came to me after crossing some turkeys on the road in pre-season while out scouting a unit for the upcoming elk season.</description>

      <description>With just weeks left in Florida, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to take advantage of Florida&amp;rsquo;s more unique opportunities before we head west. I fished a lot when I was younger, but without mentors or the internet I never had much luck. After a decade hiatus it piqued my interest again and this time around I&amp;rsquo;ve been having much better success.
Largemouth Bass If I have a favorite fish, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the largemouth bass.</description>

      <description>A little about me After joining one of Andrew&amp;rsquo;s last Backpacking Fundamentals trips in 2015, I decided to put my skills to the test by tackling section 4 of the Wind River High Route. Prior to that I had completed several trips on the Appalachian Trail and on the Florida Trail. The Wind River High Route not only promised adventure but freedom from fixed itineraries, designated campsites and complex permitting schemes.</description>
