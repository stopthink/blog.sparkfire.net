      <description>Here in Colorado we have the pleasure of chasing after a mountain dwelling sub-species of turkey, the Merriam&amp;rsquo;s. They live in the mountains, migrate up and down with the snow line, are vocal breeders and can be called, just like elk! We dove in this year trying something new and had a blast.
Pre-Season Scouting The idea for this hunt first came to me after crossing some turkeys on the road in pre-season while out scouting a unit for the upcoming elk season.</description>
