      <description>This was my first time fly fishing ever. After attending St Peter&amp;rsquo;s Fly Fishing school on Saturday, I went out on the water on my own in search of trout.
I got on the water around 8am, and it was a beautiful day, sunny and fairly warm. Just the day before it was cold and rainy, the precipitation coming down as rain and snow intermittently.
The Cache la Poudre River is one of the last remaining freestone rivers on the front range, meaning that it flows seasonally with the snowmelt.</description>
