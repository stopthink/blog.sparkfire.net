      <description>This was my first time fly fishing ever. After attending St Peter&amp;rsquo;s Fly Fishing school on Saturday, I went out on the water on my own in search of trout.
I got on the water around 8am, and it was a beautiful day, sunny and fairly warm. Just the day before it was cold and rainy, the precipitation coming down as rain and snow intermittently.
The Cache la Poudre River is one of the last remaining freestone rivers on the front range, meaning that it flows seasonally with the snowmelt.</description>

      <description>With just weeks left in Florida, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to take advantage of Florida&amp;rsquo;s more unique opportunities before we head west. I fished a lot when I was younger, but without mentors or the internet I never had much luck. After a decade hiatus it piqued my interest again and this time around I&amp;rsquo;ve been having much better success.
Largemouth Bass If I have a favorite fish, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the largemouth bass.</description>
