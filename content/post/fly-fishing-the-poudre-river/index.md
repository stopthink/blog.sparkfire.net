This was my first time fly fishing ever. After attending St Peter's Fly Fishing school on Saturday, I went out on the water on my own in search of trout.

I got on the water around 8am, and it was a beautiful day, sunny and fairly warm. Just the day before it was cold and rainy, the precipitation coming down as rain and snow intermittently.

The Cache la Poudre River is one of the last remaining freestone rivers on the front range, meaning that it flows seasonally with the snowmelt. This time of the year the river is still pre-runoff and the water is cool and clear.

## My First Fish on a Fly
I was fishing a nypmh pattern under a bobber and it didn't take long for the action to start. Before I knew it, I had hooked and landed my very first trout, and my first fish on a fly.

 I had some trouble working the pools on the far end of the river, because the water channel running down the middle was moving so fast. But after some concerted, conscious effort I was able to float my rig down the far side into a nice deep pool where I hooked up with this great big rainbow. It measured just over 13", a fair bit bigger than the average size for this river.
